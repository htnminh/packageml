# PackageML User Flow Designs

This directory contains user flow design diagrams for the main workflows in PackageML, a no-code machine learning platform designed for accessibility and ease of use.

## Diagrams

1. [**Complete User Journey**](0-complete-user-journey.md) - Overview of how all workflows connect
2. [**Onboarding Flow**](1-onboarding-flow.md) - User signup, login, and initial dashboard access
3. [**Dataset Management Flow**](2-dataset-management-flow.md) - Uploading, viewing, and managing datasets
4. [**Model Training Flow**](3-model-training-flow.md) - Creating and running machine learning jobs
5. [**API Integration Flow**](4-api-integration-flow.md) - Deploying models and managing API access
6. [**Results Visualization Flow**](5-results-visualization-flow.md) - Exploring model performance and explanations

## How to View

These diagrams use Mermaid.js for rendering. You can view them:

1. Directly in GitHub, which renders Mermaid diagrams natively
2. In any Markdown editor that supports Mermaid syntax
3. Online at [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/) by copying the diagram code

## Design Principles

These user flows are designed around key principles:

- **Accessibility**: Making ML accessible to non-experts
- **Guided Experience**: Clear step-by-step processes
- **Explainability**: Focus on understanding models, not just creating them
- **Integration**: Seamless path from data to deployed predictions
- **Education**: Supporting learning throughout the process
