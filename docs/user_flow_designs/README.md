# PackageML User Flow Designs

This directory contains user flow design diagrams for the main workflows in PackageML, a no-code machine learning platform designed for accessibility and ease of use.

## Diagrams

1. [**Complete User Journey**](1_complete-user-journey.md) - Overview of how all workflows connect
2. [**Onboarding Flow**](2_onboarding-flow.md) - User signup, login, and initial dashboard access
3. [**Dataset Management Flow**](3_dataset-management-flow.md) - Uploading, viewing, and managing datasets
4. [**Model Training & Results Flow**](4_model-training-flow.md) - Creating, running, and analyzing ML jobs
5. [**API & MCP Integration Flow**](5_api-mcp-integration-flow.md) - Full API access and MCP implementation

## How to View

These diagrams use Mermaid.js for rendering. You can view them:

1. Directly in GitHub, which renders Mermaid diagrams natively
2. In any Markdown editor that supports Mermaid syntax
3. Online at [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/) by copying the diagram code

## Design Principles

These user flows are designed around key principles:

- **Accessibility**: Making ML accessible to non-experts
- **Guided Experience**: Clear step-by-step processes
- **Explainability**: Focus on understanding models, not just creating them
- **Integration**: Seamless path from data to deployed predictions
- **Full API Access**: All UI functionality available programmatically via API
- **Context Awareness**: MCP implementation for context-rich prediction integration
