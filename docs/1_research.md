# Problem statement
Machine‑learning’s benefits remain locked away from most individuals and small organisations because installing libraries, securing hardware, and writing code are daunting hurdles. Even “free” cloud notebooks still demand Python skills and their sessions often expire before non‑experts finish a project. Hiring a data‑science team is out of reach for tight budgets. Once a model is trained, another wall appears: getting predictions back into day‑to‑day tools while keeping the “who‑what‑when” context for every decision. Without a standard model‑context protocol, people end up copy‑pasting CSV files or stitching brittle glue code that breaks, loses provenance, and blocks automation. At the same time, predictions often feel like black boxes, so stakeholders distrust and ignore them. Commercial AutoML services try to help but lock users into pricey, proprietary clouds and still assume technical literacy, while offering little control over workflow integration. None provide a lightweight, self‑hosted option that a single person can spin up on modest hardware and that speaks a universal context protocol. As a result, teachers, NGOs, and small businesses miss out on data‑driven insights that could improve lives and services. PackageML bridges this gap with a no‑code web interface, automatic or user‑chosen algorithms, clear natural‑language explanations, and a built‑in Model‑Context‑Protocol (MCP) server that streams predictions (plus full provenance) straight to downstream apps—‑all bundled in one Docker‑Compose stack small enough for a hobby‑grade server. By slashing technical barriers, adding transparency, and making integration friction‑free, the platform democratises trustworthy, actionable ML for everyone.

# Similar applications
- Google Colab — removes local setup headaches but still requires Python coding, has session time‑outs, and cannot be self‑hosted.
- Kaggle Notebooks — great for exploratory work, yet coding skills are mandatory and sessions shut down after inactivity.
- H2O Driverless AI — powerful AutoML with explanations, but commercial, memory‑hungry, and impractical for a 4–8 GB server.
- DataRobot — enterprise‑oriented, licence‑based, and cloud‑locked; too costly and heavyweight for individuals or small NGOs.
- Azure ML Studio (Designer) — low‑code drag‑and‑drop tied to Azure pricing and quotas, with no simple offline deployment.
- IBM Watson AutoAI — automates pipelines but limits algorithm choice and forces users onto IBM Cloud subscriptions.
- RapidMiner Studio — desktop GUI lowers coding needs but is memory‑hungry, assumes data‑prep know‑how, and lacks one‑click explanatory reports.

# Features that help solve the problem
- Zero‑install, single‑docker deployment – the whole stack (frontend, API, backend, MySQL, MCP server) fits into one Docker‑Compose file and runs on an 8 GB / 4‑vCPU server, slashing infrastructure cost and setup time.
- No‑code modelling with auto‑ or manual algorithm selection – users upload data, pick an algorithm (or let the system choose), tweak hyper‑parameters in simple forms, and launch jobs via web UI or REST; no Python required.
- Built‑in explainability, run history, and contextual insights – every model returns plain‑language explanations, key feature importances, and quick visualisations, while the MCP layer streams predictions with full context and all datasets, parameters, and results are stored for easy comparison and audit.
