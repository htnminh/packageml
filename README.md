## Prompts and results
- See the **prompts** here: [Prompts](docs/0_prompts.md)
- See the **results** here: [docs](docs)

All the prompts are feed into OpenAI o3 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet, using ChatGPT (with some advanced functionalities like search and deep research), Cursor, and Claude desktop.

The replies of LLMs will be omitted, they would be unnecessarily long and hard to get. Only the final results (after my modifications) are shown.
